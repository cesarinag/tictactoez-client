# TicTacToez-Client : A Description
#### This application allows the user to create an account, login and start as player X on a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game board. There's also a button that allows the user to view how many games they've played. This is my first project as a fellow at General Assembly program under their Software Engineering Immersive program.

## My initial planning going into this project was centered around staying as organized as possible and I think for the most part, I was able to remain organized - though not as DRY as I'd like. Very grateful that the instructors emphasized the benefit of module exports because I was able to complete this project in a similar fashion. The curl scripts are separated by the different controllers; user authorization events had their own folder and the game events had their own folders.

## Unsolved Problems:
* I'd still like to be able to have pictures pop up depending on the game results
* I'd like to move the change-password into a modal and prompt it in case someone forgets their password
* I'd like to add mobile functionality
